## Pomodoro Timer - README

## Overview
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python's tkinter module. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application allows you to start and reset the timer, with visual feedback for work periods and breaks.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
The tkinter module (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website.
Make sure you have the necessary Python files: main.py and tomato.png.
Files
main.py: The main script file containing the Pomodoro timer logic.
tomato.png: An image file of a tomato used for the timer background.

## Running the Application
Place all the necessary files (main.py, tomato.png) in the same directory.
Run the main.py script using Python:
python main.py
A window will pop up displaying the Pomodoro timer interface.
Click the "start" button to start the timer.
Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.

## Application Logic
The timer alternates between work sessions and breaks. After four work sessions, a longer break is taken.
Work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks are controlled by constants that define their duration.
The timer counts down from the set time and displays the remaining time.
When the timer reaches zero, it automatically starts the next session and updates the UI accordingly.
The application provides visual feedback for the current session type (work, short break, long break) and displays check marks for completed work sessions.
Dependencies
tkinter: A built-in Python module used for creating graphical user interfaces.
Future Improvements
Add customizable settings for work session and break durations.
Implement notifications or sound alerts for session transitions.
Enhance the UI with more interactive features and visual effects.
